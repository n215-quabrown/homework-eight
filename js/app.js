    <h1>A new type of D&D Actual-Play Podcast</h1>
    <p>Unprepared Casters is a longform podcast made of short form arcs. Many Dungeons & Dragons gameplay
        podcasts (often refered to as "actual play" shows) are extremely long campaigns that follow the same set
        of player characters for hundreds of episodes. Gus Rachels and Haley Whipjack decided that they wanted a
        new style of show for a D&D podcast, and created the arc model for Unprepared Casters. The show is built
        out of short arcs consisting of approximately six epsiodes each, with a new cast of guest players for
        each new arc. The two takes turns as the Dungeon Master from arc to arc, leading to a new and exciting
        style of podcast that does not require any binge listening. There are currently seven arc of the show,
        with the most recent being a departure from the "never need to listen to past content" model as a sequel
        arc of the first.

<p class="left">Unprepared Casters is free to listen to, but is optionally crowdfunded by a Patreon, which
    has a pledge of $5,109 per month. The
    Patreon has five tiers: $2, $5, $10, $15, and $25 per month. Each tier provides all
    of the benefits of each lower tier in addition to its own benefits.</p>
<div class="logo"></div>
<p class="right">The podcast's model of short arcs very loosely strung together has allowed the world of the
    podcast to develop slowly and naturally. Every arc so far has taken place in the kingdom of Hyranor.
    Several of the arcs have taken place in a specific region of the kingdom known as the Upnorth, which
    contains only one city: Glecaria.</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutGus">
<div class="gusHeadshot"></div>
<p>Gus Rachels is one of the co-hosts of the show, and is the Dungeon Master for each even numbered arc. His
    general style for the arcs thus far has been to use Dungeons & Dragons as a medium for genre stories.
    Gus' largest additions to the world of Unprepared Casters have been the thriving city of Glaceria and
    the expansiveness of the Lovejoy family, a powerful and rich family that dominates the politics of the
    entire kingdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="aboutHaley">
<p>Haley Whipjack is one of the co-hosts of the show, and is the Dungeon Master for each odd numbered arc.
    Her style so far for the arcs has been to tell slight variations on classic D&D stories and adventures,
    contrasting with the bizzare genre stories of Gus' arcs. Haley's additions to the world of Unprepared
    Casters are generally smaller scale, but build the smaller lore of the everyday people in the kingdom.
    Examples of this would be the long-dead profession of sky piracy, and several towns within the world,
    including Tyle, the capital city.</p>

    <p>Arc one of Unprepared Casters is a simple low-leveled adventure centered around the core of the
        platonic ideal of a game of Dungeons & Dragons. The party meets in a tavern, leaves town on a quest,
        enteres a dungeon, and finds a dragon. Haley was the Dungeon Master for this inaugural adventure of
        the Unprepared Casters podcast.</p>
</div>
<div class="arcTile">
    <p>Arc two of Unprepared Casters is a heist story. This adventure sees four criminals come together
        under the leadership of Robyn Lovejoy to rob a large jemstone from the Lovejoy famaily, a powerful
        noble family in the city of Glaceria. This inevitably leads to disasterous complications, but the
        players manage to succeed in their ultimate goals. Gus is the Dungeon Master for this off-the-wall
        adventure.</p>
    <div class="arcLogo" id="arcTwo"></div>

<div class="arcTile">
    <div class="arcLogo" id="arcThree"></div>
    <p>The third arc of Unprepared Casters sees the return of Haley as the Dungeon Master for the first
        high-level adventure of the podcast. A team that previously saved the world from an infernal
        invasion is reconvened by their wizard, Annie (played by Gus), on suspicion of a return from the
        devils they thought they defeated years ago. This arc culminates in a high-stakes battle beneath the
        city of Glaceria for the fate of the entire kingdom of Hyranor.</p>
</div>
<div class="arcTile">
    <p>The fourth arc of Unprepared Casters is the return of Gus as Dungeon Master for another
        unconventional story for Dungeons & Dragons, this time with a sports themed arc. This is the first
        level 1 adventure of the podcast, and sees a group of teenagers thrust into an ancient evil ritual
        centered around the sport of orbula.</p>

    <div class="arcLogo" id="arcFive"></div>
    <p>Unprepared Casters' fifth arc is advertised as a festival story, and is run by Haley. The party of
        this arc consists of festival employees and atendees alike, who must solve a mystery before
        Fulldark, midnight on the longest night of the year. This arc takes place in the past of Hyranor,
        approximately 200 years before the time period that the first four arcs of the podcast take place
        in.</p>
</div>
<div class="arcTile">
    <p>Unprepared Casters' sixth arc is advertised as the deadly survival arc, run by Gus. This arc sees the
        last crew of sky pirates in Hyranor crashing in the harsh Upnorth, forced to walk though frigid
        conditions through the ice and snow to the only save haven this far north, the protected city of
        Glaceria. This arc takes place in the past as well, approximately 50 years after arc five.</p>

    <div class="arcLogo" id="arcSeven"></div>
    <p>The most recent and currently running arc of the podcast is the seventh, a direct sequel to the first
        run by Haley. This adventure sees the party of the first arc reunited three years after the ending
        of that adventure. The characters have all grown and developed different amounts, having seperated
        and followed their own paths in life. </p>
